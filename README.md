# [Spaceholder](http://spaceholder.co/)

Spaceholder is a quick & easy way to use cool space photos in your design mockups. Probably only useful during a space hackathon â€” for everthing else you're looking for [Placekitten](http://placekitten.com)

Created as a sub-hack whilst making [MadeByNASA](http://madebynasa.meteor.com) during the International Space Apps Challenge, April 2013.

## Usage
- Clone the repo
- Add a directory of rad space images to /raw
- You might also need to ```mkdir -p tmp/cache/body tmp/cache/meta```
- Locally, ```rackup config.ru``` will work. On a server do your nginx thing.
