# [Faceholder](http://faceholder.co/)

Faceholder is an easy way to get faces for mockups. I'm using [Sarah Parmenter's avatar set](http://www.sazzy.co.uk/2011/11/downloadable-pack-of-avatars-for-webpsd-mock-ups/) but use whatever you want.

No idea how scalable this is; probably not very. I'm crap at caches.
